/**

 * topmost view in the stack. Unity cannot be attached to more than one view, so there
 * should only ever be one EmbedUnity widget on a Flutter screen - however we still
 * need to account for the fact that when pushing a new Flutter route / screen onto
 * the Navigator stack, both screens are still alive and so we can end up with more
 * than one PlatformView at the same time (but only the top one will be visible)
